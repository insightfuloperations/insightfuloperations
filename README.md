This Github account contains all the code developed for the purpose of demonstrating our capabilities as well as for reuse to expedite Project engagements.

At present, it contains the following:

1. A basic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Python asset that takes a series of GPS coordinates from an Excel file and orders it based on the shortest path from a starting/distribution point. Uses IBM Cplex.
2. The exact same result using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm in Python. Much faster, no additional library overheads or vendor licensing required, but results may not be as optimal especially with larger numbers of waypoints.
3. A more user-friend GUI version using C# with the .NET platform using WinForms for the Windows Platform. Features point-and-click capability to select waypoints on a map in addition to ingesting data from an Excel or CSV file. Makes heavy use of the Google Maps API and Open Route Service API (https://openrouteservice.org/) which will require API keys.
4. A basic Nurse Scheduling Asset using Google OR that uses most of the sample code from the Google OR Tools samples.
5. The same basic Nurse Scheduling Asset as in (4) with IBM Cplex as the industrial solver instead.
